        <p>Using the previous logos above, I created a UX research project. In this research I interviewed a few different people and gathered their feedback on the logos. I then sorted this data and used it to redesign my logos. After, I put all this information together in a presentation. </p>

           <p><em>1. Consider the role of rhetoric, technology, and ethics in acts of making.</em></p>
              <p>Before completing these projects, we read a good amount from the chapters of The Non-Designers Design Book by Robin Williams. Within these reading we learned the best practices for text, color schemes, alignment, and more. This new knowledge was then applied to our creation of our designs. </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="col-sm-4">
            <p><em>2. Leverage Design Principles.</em></p>
              <p>These projects leverage design principles by incorporating several different web tools that can perform different design tasks. Given the opportunity to use my different tools, I can be sure to create designs that are well thought out in every aspect. </p>
    </div>

             <p><em>3. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
              <p>These projects allow me to engage with my peers in class to communicate any questions and doubts I may have regarding my design and getting their input. I can use their input to improve my designs. Our communication also allows us to all grow our knowledge by sharing information that we may not have known already. </p>

              <p>All of these projects require revision and adjustments as we discover the best practices for each design. Specifically, the logo designs we created required feedback and revision to become their best form. </p>

      <p>For this project, I worked with a client to create a design for their specific need. My client needed a design to present her project brief scenarios to her students. This project occured over two weeks, where I was in communication with my client frequently over calls and emails.</p>

            <p><em>1. Consider the role of rhetoric, technology, and ethics in acts of making.</em></p>
               <p>When creating these projects, it was important to make sure they were accesible to all audiences who may be viewing the designs. It is important to consider accessibility in design when selecting what colors, fonts, and images will be used. Elements, such as contrast, help make a viewers' experience more enjoyable. Since most of these short form designs were posters or advertisements a clear and consistent navigation should be provided.  </p>
     </div>
     
     <div class="col-sm-4">
             <p><em>2. Leverage Design Principles.</em></p>
               <p>Most of these short form design projects had a lot of words to organize. This required the utilization of design principles to set up the information in each design in a way that allowed the viewer to understand the purpose of the design without any confusion. These design principles include alignment, spacing, and text size and style. </p>

     <div class="col-sm-4">
              <p><em>3. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
               <p>Most of these projects were created with the help of inspiration from previously designed work. As a part of our class workshop, we share designs in a discussion board that we may have found online or in magazines that caught our eye. By sharing these designs with one another, we are provided with many sources of inspiration we can use towards our own designs. This collaboration in our class workshops helps us to create more unique and creative pieces.   </p>

               <p>Revision was especially relevant in the client project. This project required working with another person's design expectations in addition to my own design ideas. When presenting my work to my client, I welcomed her feedback and then made revisions based off of that. Revisions helped me make sure my client's needs were satisfied and I was happy with my design.</p>

I wanted to start off by showing the elements I specifically enjoyed, but then was sure to be open to my audiences' opinions and feedback on what I could improve. </p>

        <p>The goal of this project was to design four pages spread on a theme of our choice. The theme I selected was the musical artist Noah Kahan.

        <p>For this project, I designed ten pages of a publication with a theme. The theme I selected was Christmas in New York. I used sample publications to help design a coherent and attractive spread. I incorporated placeholder text, headings, and captions in my design. </p>

        <p>This project required the use of viewer feedback to help establish our brand designs. I chose to create a brand that is a holiday decor subscription box.

        <p><em>1. Consider the role of rhetoric, technology, and ethics in acts of making.</em></p>
           <p>When completing the publication spreads, inclusivity played a big role in selecting elements regarding the language, colors, balance, and repetition that was used. The goal of these designs was to have them appeal to a diverse group of people. Thinking about the barriers some people may face, helps to try and create an inclusive design.</p>
 </div>
 
 <div class="col-sm-4">
         <p><em>2. Leverage Design Principles.</em></p>
           <p>When designing the publication spreads, it was important to consider the design principle of repetition. Since there were multiple pages in the designs, adding elements of repetition made it more cohesive. This helps the viewer to understand that all the pages are related to one another. </p>

          <p><em>3. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
           <p>During the presentations of the UX Design Branding Project, I was able to hear about the experiences my classmates had during this research process.

           <p>Revision was needed within each of these long form projects I completed. By being able to get feedback from my professor, classmates, and friends on my designs, I was able to narrow down the image I was trying to create. Getting this feedback, helps to point out things you may be missing or elements that aren't needed that the designer could not see themself.  </p>
